    <h2>Summary of Features</h2>

    <p>The Employee Evaluation page is used to record your rating of the employees on your team. Each employee is rated on individual competencies and completion of goals.
        Using the formula from the chart on the home page and your input on this page, the system records an overall competency score and a final result score from each employee.
        These scores are composed from individual competency ratings and goal completion which are entered in the text-boxes shown on the page.</p>

    <h3><a name="nav">Navigation and Filtering Features</a></h3>
    <p>The top bar on the page - shown in the image below - contains a number of navigation and filtering features.  A group-manager can use the filtering features to see all of
        her direct reports, managers, and those who report to those managers on the same page, or she can filter down to just those who directly report to her. A front-line manager
        can choose to see all of the roles and grades in his organization, or he can filter down to a single role and a single grade in his organization.  An explanation of these
        capabilities follows.
    </p>
    <div class="centered">
    <table>
        <tr><td colspan="4"><img src="../images/Filter%20Bar%20with%20Braces.png"></td></tr>
        <tr>
            <td><a href="#breadcrumb">Breadcrumb</a></td>
            <td><a href="#mgrvis">Manager Visibility Filter</a></td>
            <td><a href="#grdvis">Grade Visibility Filter</a></td>
            <td><a href="#rlvis">Role Visibility Filter</a></td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </div>

    <h4><a name="breadcrumb">Breadcrumb</a></h4>
    <p>The breadcrumb shows the current selected manager, the number of employees currently shown on the page, presents a link to go back to the home screen, and to select another manager.
        In the image above, the bread crumb has 'Home' and 'Travis Jones - 5' buttons.  When selected, the home button immediately takes the user back to the home screen.  The 'Travis Jones - 5' button
        presents the currently selected manager and also indicates how many employees are shown on the current page.  Selecting filtering options, which are explained in the following sections, will modify
        the number of employees shown and therefore the number displayed on this button.  Selecting this button will take the user back to the manager selection page which allows a group manager to choose
        among his managers.  For front-line managers, the previous page only allows him to select himself.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="mgrvis">Manager Visibility Filter</a></h4>
    <p>
        The Manager Visibility Filter allows a manager to select between presenting all of his employees on the page including managers and direct reports and options to focus in on one of those groups. The
        currently selected filter is indicated by an asterisk on the selected tab.
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">D</span> - Allows the manager to see just his direct reports.  For group managers, this would exclude any employees that report to managers in his organization.  For front-line managers,
                clicking this will have no effect.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">M</span> - Allows a manager to see just those managers that report to him and excludes any other direct reports.  For group managers, this filter allows them to see only the managers
                that report to them and would exclude roles like Group Architects or Principle Engineers that directly report to him.  For front-line managers, selecting this filter will show an empty list as no
                other managers report to them.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">-M</span> - Allows a manager to see just those directs who are not managers themselves.  For group managers, applying this filter allows them to see just the Architects and Principle Engineers
                who are not people managers.  For front-line managers, applying this filter has no effect.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">+M</span> - Enables a manager to see all of the employees that report to him and those who report to managers in his organization.  This is the default Manager Visibility Filter and
                is set by default upon initial view of this page.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h4><a name="grdvis">Grade Visibility Filter</a></h4>
    <p>
        All of the appropriate engineering grades from 88-99 are listed which allow a manager to filter the employee table to just those employees in a specific grade.  The <span class="bold">All</span> filter is the default
        filter and allows a manager to show all of the grades at the same time.
    </p>

    <h4><a name="rlvis">Role Visibility Filter</a></h4>
    <p>
        This filter acts as a toggle and shows either all of the possible roles at once or shows just those employees with a specific role delineated in the following list:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">All</span> - Shows all of the roles at once.  This is the default filter and is set by default upon initial view of the page.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">SD</span> - Software Developer role.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">WD</span> - Web Developer role.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">UX</span> - User Experience role.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">QA</span> - Quality Assurance role.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">AU</span> - Authorities role.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">PG</span> - Program Management role.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>The Employees table</h3>
    <p>
        The Employees table shows all of a managers direct reports according to the selected filters as outlined above. The table is used to record the manager's evaluation of each employee in specific competency categories
        goal fields.  The operation of the header and fields is discussed in the following section.
    </p>
    <div class="centered"><img src="../images/Employee%20Table%20Header.png"></div>
    <p>
        All of the column headings are selectable and change the sort order when selected.  Sorts are always
        applied first in an ascending fashion and, if selected again, in a descending fashion.  Some of the columns of the table are not user-modifiable like Employee ID or Name. Some columns are user-modifiable and are used
        to record a manager's evaluation of the employee in that competency or to provide an evaluation of how well the employee did regarding their goals.  The columns that are user-modifiable are those that use text-boxes
        and will allow the user insert a blinking caret by selecting the box.  Those columns that have non-user-modifiable data will not allow the user to select them.  Two of the columns, <span class="bold">Comp Score</span>
        and <span class="bold">Result Score</span>, are calculated fields that use the data input by the manager and a simple algorithm to calculate their contents.  Changing the user-modifiable columns will change the values
        contained in those columns.
