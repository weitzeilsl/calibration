    <h2>Family History Management Tool</h2>

    <p>This tool was developed to provide a consistent method for evaluating our employees and to help raise our organization to higher standards.  We believe that this will happen as we reward
        and recognize those who are high performing and correct, encourage, coach and mentor those who are not performing to their full capacity.  Excellent managers do all of these things.</p>

    <h3><a name="overview">Process Overview</a></h3>
    <p>The <a href="Overview.html">Process Overview</a> page provides an overview of the ATI/AMI process and also some guidance about how the data provided by a manager is used to determine an overall AMI.</p>
    
    <h3>Competencies</h3>
    <p>All evaluations and rankings on this site are based upon well defined competencies (click here to download the <a href='Competencies.xlsx'>Competency Definition Worksheet</a>).  We encourage all managers and employees to familiarize themselves with these definitions prior to beginning the Evaluation and Ranking process.</p>

    <h3><a name="Evaluate">Evaluation</a></h3>
    <p>The Evaluate tab allows you to record your rating of each employee's performance against their competencies per role and grade.  More information is provided on the <a href="../help/Evaluate.html">Evaluate</a> help page.</p>

    <h3><a name="Rank">Rank</a></h3>
    <p>The Rank tab allows you to record your stack-rankings of each employee in their own grade and role.  More information is provided on the <a href="../help/Rank.html">Rank</a> help page.</p>
