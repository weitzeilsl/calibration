        <h2>Family History Management Tool</h2>

        <p>This tool was developed to provide a consistent method for evaluating our employees and to help raise our organization to higher standards.  We believe that this will happen as we reward and recognize those who are high performing and correct, encourage, coach and mentor those who are not performing
to their full capacity.  Excellent managers do all of these things.</p>
        <p>We encourage managers to utilize a variety of resources as they evaluate their employees performance:</p>

        <ul>
    
            <li><b>Self Evaluation</b> - The Competencies tab provides a form for employees  or managers to evaluate themselves against approved competencies for their role.</li>
            <li><b>Manager Evaluation</b> - Managers should also consider the employees performance against their competencies.  They consider the
                                               employee's completion of division goals and feedback received during weekly 1:1's.  The Eval tabs (e.g., 92 Eval)
                                               provide a location for Managers to record the evaluation for each of their employees in their respective grade levels.</li>
            <li><b>360 Degree Feedback</b> - Managers should look for opportunities receive feedback from the teammates of their employees.  We do not believe
                                               that this type of feedback must be required, but we do believe that it can be an effective approach to gathering
                                               additional feedback for the employee.</li>
            <li><b>Team Stack Ranking</b> - Employees of the same grade level should be stack ranked together.  This process helps management to identify those
                                               who are high performers and those who may be in need of improvement.  This also helps us to identify the caliber of
                                               of new hires needed to lift the organization to higher levels.  The council does recommend that manager evaluations
                                               should be completed before the team stack ranks are started.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>AMI calculators are provided for each grade level. Managers should fill out the required information for their team members, however, the final approval for salary recommendations must come from the Group Manager.  It is expected that managers will not communicate their evaluation information until Group Managers have calibrated all of their managers and given the go-ahead to do so.</p>

        <p>Employees must be given clear concise communication regarding their performance.  However, managers should not communicate to employees their stack rank positions or the specific values given to them in their Evaluations.  The radar charts provided on the Evaluation tabs are for the manager's use only.</p>

        <p>The following diagram documents the logic flow of the tool.</p>

        <h3>Evaluation</h3>
        <a name="Rank"></a>
        <p>As a manager, you use this worksheet to record your rating of the level 98 employees on your team.  Columns D2:L2 list the
            competencies that each employee is being evaluated against.  The complete definition for each of these competencies can be
            found in the Competency Profile document for your specific discipline.</p>
        <p>Prior to filling out this worksheet, each employee should have evaluated themselves on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being the
            highest) against the competency profile for their discipline and level (the employee evaluation is recorded on the Self
            Evaluation worksheet).  The manager evaluates the employee's self evaluation and considers that information in combination
            with other information (e.g., 360 degree feedback) gathered during the evaluation period.</p>
        <p>The manager then records his/her evaluation of the employee's performance against the competency profile for the employee's
            level.  The  score for the employee is then calculated in the  Eval Score field (column M).   An average Eval Score is
            provided to help the manager know if his team is being ranked above or below the 3.0 mid-point.</p>
        <p>Radar charts are auto-generated for each employee.  However, the name on each radar chart must be manually entered.  These
            charts should not be shown to the employee, but are a helpful visual tool for the manager to quickly see where the employee
            excels and/or needs improvement.</p>

        <h3>Rank</h3>
        <a name="ATI"></a>
        <p>A manager uses this worksheet to determine the stack rank for the employees at level 98 within his or her team.  
            The manager should fill out the Eval tab before filling out the Rank tab. The employee's name, manager  and employee 
            id are carried over from the Eval tab. The main table (D4:L16) requires the manager to enter the values 1-5 in columns D - L.
            As the manager enters the values, the distribution table on rows 19 - 23 shows the percentage of cells containing each value.
            The manager is asked to distribute the values to meet the target values in column C as closely as possible.  As values are entered,
            an average Rank score is calculated.  The manager should award the number of values that equates to an average of exactly
            3.00 points.   This forces consistency across teams and means that for every 5 competency awarded  in a column, there must be at
            least two 2's or one 1 awarded to others. Using the pop down controls on D2:L2, the manager may sort the list for each competency.
            This provides the manager the ability to evaluate the team  members side-by-side for each competency.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this exercise is to determine a team ranking and salary comparison against their team members of the same 
            level.  This information is helpful when considering salary increases. The rank value and order is not communicated to the
            employee.  Those ranked at the bottom should be considered as candidates for performance improvement plans.  Those ranked
            the highest are potential candidates for recognition and promotion.  Those being considered for promotion should rank in the
            upper half of their new peers in their target grade.</p>

        <h3>AMI/ATI</h3>
        <p>The manager uses this worksheet to view the slider values to be entered into ATI.  A manager is not authorized to enter a different value into ATI or AMI than the one calculated here (without Group Manager aproval).   There are only two editable columns:<br>
        <lu>
            <li>The Group Manager Adjustment; and,</li>
            <li>Adjustment Justification.</li>
        </lu>
        <p>All other necessary information is pulled from the previous worksheets.</p>
